### Easy Transformer Implementation

This project provides a step-by-step guide to implementing a simplified version of the GPT-2 transformer model using the Easy-Transformer and PySvelte libraries. The implementation includes tokenization, model architecture, and text generation.

### Setup
To get started, install the necessary dependencies:

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/neelnanda-io/Easy-Transformer.git@clean-transformer-demo
pip install git+https://github.com/neelnanda-io/PySvelte.git
pip install fancy_einsum
pip install einops
pip install plotly
pip install matplotlib
pip install pysvelte
```

### Model Components
The model is built from several key components:

LayerNorm: Normalizes inputs to have mean 0 and variance 1.
Embedding: Converts tokens into vectors.
Positional Embedding: Adds positional information to the tokens.
Attention: Implements the self-attention mechanism.
MLP: A multi-layer perceptron for additional processing.
Transformer Block: Combines LayerNorm, Attention, and MLP layers.
Unembedding: Converts the final hidden states back into logits.
Full Transformer
The full transformer model consists of an embedding layer, positional embedding, multiple transformer blocks, and an unembedding layer. It processes sequences of tokens in parallel and uses attention mechanisms to learn the relationships between tokens.

### Text Generation
To generate text, the model:

Converts input text into tokens.
Passes tokens through the transformer to get logits.
Applies softmax to convert logits into probabilities.
Predicts the next token by selecting the one with the highest probability.
Repeats the process by appending the new token to the input sequence.
Model Testing
The model includes various tests to ensure components are working correctly, comparing the custom implementation against the pre-trained GPT-2 model.

### Training
A demonstration is provided to train a small GPT-2 model on a dataset using a simple training loop. The process involves:

Loading a dataset.
Tokenizing the dataset.
Creating the model and optimizer.
Running the training loop and logging the loss.
Conclusion
This project offers a detailed yet concise guide to understanding and implementing a transformer model from scratch, providing insights into the workings of modern language models like GPT-2.
